It was a dark and stormy night...
The raven mourned it's lot, screaming it's torment against the shuttering rain tap tap tapping upon my window ceil.

Deep into that darkness peering, long I stood there wondering, fearing,
Doubting, dreaming dreams no mortals ever dared to dream before;

I have nothing to say!
